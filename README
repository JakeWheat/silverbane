# Silverbane

Document based testing: test transcripts of running command line
programs, including interactive ones, in documentation - so you can
check your documentation is correct.

This program exists because I had a variety of documentation for
various projects, which contained transcripts of running command
lines, and of running interactive command line programs, and I wanted
to check the examples were correct easily.

## Example

~~~~~~{file=exampledoc.md}

This is an example of using python as a simple calculator:

~~~~{...}
>>> 1 + 2
4

~~~~

~~~~~~

TODO: show output when running this program


(The examples in this README file are checked with Silverbane.)

# Guide

The tool reads arbitrary text files, and picks out the interesting bits to check.

The things it can check are: 

* if an inline quote of a file matches the file on disk
* if running a command produces the output shown in the document
* if running an interactive command line program, sending the input in
  the document gives the output in the document

## checking interactive command lines


note: the output on error is designed to not be terse, but be usable
the output is quoted verbatim so you can e.g. write a session in your docs
with just the prompts, run silverbane, then just paste what was recorded
into your doc.
