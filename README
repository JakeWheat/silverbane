This tool serves two purposes:

Direct testing:

Write tests for the output of running command line programs, and for
the output of interactive sessions with repl style or similar command
line programms.

Document based testing:

Test transcripts of running command line programs, including
interactive ones, in documentation - so you can check your
documentation is correct.
