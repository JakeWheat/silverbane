This tool serves two purposes:

Document based testing:

Test transcripts of running command line programs, including
interactive ones, in documentation - so you can check your
documentation is correct.

Direct testing:

Write tests for the output of running command line programs, and for
the output of interactive sessions with repl style or similar command
line programs. Not sure if it's the best tool for this, but it does
allow you to write documentation with your tests.
