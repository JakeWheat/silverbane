Document based testing: test transcripts of running command line
programs, including interactive ones, in documentation - so you can
check your documentation is correct.

This program exists because I had a variety of documentation for
various projects, which contained transcripts of running command
lines, and of running interactive command line programs, and I wanted
to check the examples were correct easily.

## Example

~~~~ {file=mydoc.md}

This is an example of using python as a simple calculator:

TODO: how do you nest ~~~~ inside ~~~~
  -> pandoc has a way, copy that
 ~~~~{...}
>>> 1 + 2
4

 ~~~~

~~~~

TODO: show output when running this program


(The examples in this README file are checked with Silverbane.)

# Guide

The tool reads arbitrary text files, and picks out the interesting bits to check.

The things it can check are: 

* if an inline quote of a file matches the file on disk
* if running a command produces the output shown in the document
* if running an interactive command line program, sending the input in
  the document gives the output in the document
